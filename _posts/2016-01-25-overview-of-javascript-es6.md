Jekyll has been supporting Sass and CoffeeScript out of the box since version 2. But I found there still are limited resources to talk about the Sass set up with Jekyll,
and the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#sassscss) is a bit counter-intuitive for a first time Jekyll blogger.
                                   .

## <a name="install-scss"></a>Install Sass/SCSS

If you are a Linux user, you can install Sass by using the command line,

````bash
$ sudo su -c "gem install sass"
````

For Mac users, you can install Sass by the following command line on Terminal.app or your preferred command line application such as [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/).

````bash
$ gem install sass
````

Windows users, you can use [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/), which will give everything you need.

## <a name="create-sass-in-jekyll"></a>Create Sass/SCSS in Jekyll
You can create `.sass` or `.scss` files anywhere you would like in your Jekyll directory.
Hold on! You said Sass or SCSS? Usually people just call Sass which represent both different syntax.
I personally prefer the SCSS syntax, even though you have to type more than the Sass syntax,
but I feel more that I am coding CSS with extra smart features such as variables, mixins, nesting and inheritance rather than coding another [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You can create a `.scss` file within a `public/css` directory if you would like to put all your front end assets into the public directory.

````

│   └── css/
│       └── styles.scss
│   └── js/
│       └── main.js
├── _config.yml
└── index.html
````



And then add [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of the file, which mean, the two lines of triple dashes, *otherwise it won't work*. Like this:

````css
---
# This is the Front Matter block
---

// Your styles start here
.container {
 background: white;
}

````

Jekyll will compile your Sass files based on your current file structure if you already started running the Jekyll built-in web server by the `jekyll serve` command,
it will automatically compile your `public/css/styles.scss` file into a CSS file at `_site/public/css/styles.css`.

## <a name="link-the-compiled-css"></a>Link the compiled CSS
Once the complied CSS is in place, we can include a link to the style sheet with the `<link>` tag in your Jekyll site within the `<head>` tag.
Like this:

````html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/public/css/styles.css">
</head>
````
Or use the Jekyll site baseurl variable

{% raw %}
````html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/css/styles.css">
</head>
````
{% endraw %}

Usually we include the external style sheet in the `index.html`.
Or you can create a `head.html` in the `_includes` directory to share the same head tag definition by including it in your layout.



<br />
## <a name="import-sass"></a>Import other Sass/SCSS files using Sass imports
One of the greatest features in Sass is the `@import` feature. You can import multiple Sass files and compile them into one CSS file.

Put all your `.scss` files, partials or your UI components in the *default Sass directory* `/_sass`.
And import all the partials in your *main* Sass style sheet, in our case, `styles.scss` is the main Sass style sheet, like this:

````css
---
# This is the Front Matter block
---

// Importing Sass/SCSS partials
@import "grid";
@import "button";
@import "form";

````

You would like to change the *default Sass directory* to a different directory, we can define it in the `_config.yml` file.
In our case, we placed all the front end assets in the `/public/` directory, we can specify our own Sass directory like this:

````yaml

# We specify the directory for Jekyll so we can use @imports.
sass:
  sass_dir: public/_scss
````

*Important notes fo you*,

- The `sass_dir` works as *a load path* for Sass imports **ONLY**, don't put your main Sass style sheet in the same directory.
- **Don't insert Front Matter block** in the Sass/SCSS files or partials in the `sass_dir`. Jekyll will stop converting Sass files, and throw error messages.

<br />
## <a name="css-minification"></a>CSS minification using Sass output style options

Sass currently supports four different output styles:

- [:nested](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_13)
- [:expanded](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_14)
- [:compact](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_15)
- [:compressed](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_16)

The `:compressed` style will produce the optimal output for production.
Turn on and choose the Sass output style in `_config.yml`, like this:

````yaml
sass:
  style: compressed
````

It is simple, right? Thanks Jekyll teams for making designers and bloggers life much easier.
